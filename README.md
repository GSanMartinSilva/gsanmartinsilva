## Hey Everyone, I'm Gabriel :)

I am a PhD student at the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, UCLA. My research focuses on probabilistic graphical models, quantum computing and risk and reliability. So basically trying to identify opportunities that mix those three fields. 

You can contact me at gsanmartin@ucla.edu for university stuff or g.sanmartin.silva@gmail.com for personal stuff ðŸ™‚

Also, feel free to visit the webpage of the lab I work here at UCLA: <a href="https://tensorworks.seas.ucla.edu" target="_blank">TensorWorks</a>.
